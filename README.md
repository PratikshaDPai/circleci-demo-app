## CircleCI Demo App â€“ Support Engineer Take Home Assessment


This is a simple web application and CircleCI pipeline created as part of the Support Engineer take-home assessment.

The project demonstrates the following skills:


- Building a trivial web application with HTML + JavaScript

- Writing an automated test with Jest + Testing Library (jsdom)

- Configuring a CircleCI pipeline to build and test the application


When you open index.html in a browser, you'll see:

	- A button labeled "Click Me"

	- A hidden paragraph ("Hello from CircleCI!")

Clicking the button reveals the hidden text.
